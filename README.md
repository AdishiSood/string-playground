# 🔤 String Coding Practice

This repository is dedicated to solving **String-related** problems using Java. It includes problems from LeetCode, GFG, and other coding platforms—categorized by difficulty and patterns.

## 🧠 Why Strings?
Strings are one of the most asked topics in coding interviews. They cover key concepts like:
- Two Pointers
- Sliding Window
- Hashing (Maps, Sets)
- Recursion & Backtracking
- Dynamic Programming
- Pattern Matching

## 🗂️ Folder Structure
- `easy/` – Basic string manipulation
- `medium/` – Problems requiring intermediate techniques like sliding window, hashmap, etc.
- `hard/` – Complex string parsing, DP on strings, regex
- `notes/` – Handy references, patterns, and Java functions

## 🚀 Language
- Java (Java 8+)
